Dear {!Contact.Name},


This is to inform you that {!Contact.OwnerFullName} has left TE Connectivity with short notice. For any questions and support are you welcome to contact me or Holger Müller, h.mueller@te.com (Account Manager for TE Rail). Until we have found a solution for a dedicated support after Adrian will I assign your requests to another Sales person within the German TE Rail Sales Team.


Let me know if you have any questions about this and I and the TE Rail sales team are looking forward to support you.


Kind regards
