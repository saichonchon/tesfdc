Dear {!Opportunity.OwnerFullName}, 

you have changed the currency for opportunity {!Opportunity.Link}.

If you have not edited and saved your forecast after this change, you must go to the forecast section for that opportunity, click 'edit' and then 'save' without making changes in the forecast.

This action is necessary to correctly re-calculate the revenue values in the new currency you have selected.

Please make sure your forecast values are showing the correct amount in the new currency !
