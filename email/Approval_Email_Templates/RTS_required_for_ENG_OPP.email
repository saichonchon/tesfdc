Dear User, 

For your information

The Opportunity : {!Opportunity.Name} was approved by Regional Product Manager and moved to the next step of the opportunity approval process (if necessary).

While Regional Product Manager required a RTS EQR for further follow up. PLS create the RTS request from SFDC and assign back to your regional PM ASAP!

Click on link: {!Opportunity.Link} to access your opportunity and create RTS from there!

Thanks
SFDC admin
